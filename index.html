                    <p>The "Perle di Stelle"<span class="upper-case">&#174;</span> brand is characterized by unique
                        jewelry collections, handmade in
                        Venice, using Murano glass and real meteorites. We wanted to combine Venice with the immensity
                        of space! </p>

                    <p>Imagine being in the most beautiful and romantic city in the world, on a clear night and
                        observing the stars and the moon reflected in the water of one of its canals or even better of
                        its lagoon.</p>

                    <p>It is not easy to capture the essence and spirituality of such a fascinating painting and
                        transform it into objects made to be worn! We at "Perle di Stelle"<span
                            class="upper-case">&#174;</span> together with Momylia
                        managed to do it! We have created jewels made with Murano glass, which are truly unique,
                        involving science, craftsmanship and technology!</p>

                    <p>Thanks to a meticulous work, entirely handmade and consisting of a mix of glass, rocks from space
                        and precious metals, we have created jewels with the intention of going beyond simple ornament!
                    </p>

                    <p>All parts are assembled by hand using quality elements, mostly 925 silver. Our brand ensures a
                        lifetime guarantee on all creations. The jewels are also designed for lovers of craftsmanship
                        and as such, you will never find two absolutely alike. The work is done by artisans who first
                        acquired the necessary practice to combine Murano glass with extraterrestrial rock fragments,
                        which are mostly older than our own planet!</p>

                    <p>Most of the meteorites that fall to Earth are of asteroid origin, but there are also from the
                        Moon and Mars. Here's how this is possible:</p>
                    <p>Over time, all planets, including ours, are subject to even large meteoroid impacts, the
                        energy released by such impacts on the surface of rocky planets or satellites can be large
                        enough to hurl rocks into space. a speed even higher than the escape velocity of the parent
                        body, such rocks disperse in interplanetary space and gradually can also fall on the Earth.
                        For this reason, from time to time, Martian and lunar meteorites fall, and probably also
                        from other planets. The certainty that the meteorite comes from the Moon or from Mars is
                        determined by a mineralogical comparison made with the lunar samples collected mainly by the
                        astronauts from the Apollo missions or by the analyzes made by the space probes that went to
                        Mars. In both cases, integration with information regarding isotopic abundance is what makes
                        the origin sure.</p>

                        about astronomy and the creativity of his wife Ecaterina Adam.</p>
                    <p>After months of work to study the adaptability of different types of meteorites on Murano glass,
                        Maurizio and Ecaterina have found a very valid and irreplaceable collaboration with "Momylia"
                        (Emilia Rizzo and Mauro Zennaro).</p>
                    <p>True experts in the art of Venetian pearl making, Mauro and his wife Emilia immediately accepted
                        with pleasure and enthusiasm the challenge of creating jewelry by incorporating extraterrestrial
                        fragments into the glass!</p>
                    <p>Thanks to their great passion and over thirty years of experience in lampworking glass. Guided by
                        the wonderful idea they were pursuing, namely that of enclosing a piece of the Universe within
                        Murano glass.</p>
                    <p>After some time they obtained truly brilliant results was born the union between "Perle di
